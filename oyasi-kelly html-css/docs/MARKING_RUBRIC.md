| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic HTML** | Uses perfect semantic tags (nav, main, section, footer, article, etc). | Most tags are semantic, some div-heavy sections. | No semantic tags used. |
| **Vanilla CSS** | Mastered Flexbox/Grid, variables, and responsive units. Zero bugs. | Good layout, some minor alignment issues on mobile. | Not responsive, broken layouts. |
| **Tailwind Workflow** | Expert use of utility classes, hover states, and responsive prefixes. | Correct usage but some redundant styles. | Incorrect integration or missing utility patterns. |
| **UI/UX Fidelity** | Premium feel, consistent spacing, and polished interactions. | Matches layout but lacks fine polish. | Design is inconsistent or unreadable. |
| **Form Design** | Accessible inputs, clear labels, and logical flow. | Basic form, all fields present. | Missing labels or unusable on mobile. |

**Total Possible Points: 25**
